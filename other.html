Ask them to sign in to their Spotify, GoodReads, LetterBoxed, Youtube, etc. and give them an artistic profile and match people with similar tastes. Could probably use embeddings models...</li>
                            
                            <li><strong>Dating App for People who Don't like Dating Apps:</strong> No matching algorithm, just gives advice on how to talk to people in real life. As a bit.</li>
                            
                            <li><strong>Secret Fiction PPT Show:</strong> Have a group dinner where everyone presents PPTs on specific topics but 1 of the guests is selected to fill their deck with realistic lies on their topic. At the end of night, have to guess which presentation was mostly lies.</li>
                            
                            <li><strong>Auto-tuned Rap Conversation:</strong> I want to take a mundane conversation (like my mom telling me to eat my vitamins) and turn it into a low key banger. Inspired by Fred Again but for comedic purposes</li>
                            
                            <li><strong>Host a Fake Indian Wedding:</strong> Organize a fake Indian wedding/show with my friends as actors (bride, groom, parents, an ex-boyfriend to give speeches, reception performances). Film a wedding video (interview the guests).</li>
