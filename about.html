        <blockquote>“I’m so embarrassed. I’m not a real person yet.” <br>

            Born in 1997, I was raised in 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey" target="_blank">Paradise</a> 
            by my earnest and hard working family. I live in NYC now but still visit them often.

        <blockquote>“When you tell [adults] about a new friend, they never ask questions about what really matters. They never ask: <br>
             ‘What does his voice sound like?’ <br>
             ‘What games does he like best?’ <br>
              ‘Does he collect butterflies?’ <br>
            They ask:<br>
             ‘How old is he?’ <br>
              ‘How many brothers does he have?’<br>
              ‘How much does he weigh?’ <br>
               ‘How much money does he have?’ <br>
                Only then do they think they know him.” <br>
            - from The Little Prince

            My favorite color is this orange. My favorite animal is a panda. I know how to do three magic tricks (but mess up the third one a lot so it’s more like two). I get the most frustrated when I can’t understand someone I care about. I’m allergic to tree nuts. I like doing bad improv. I really like getting my friends to do bad improv. I know that I’m a sensitive person but I don’t like it when people call me that. My favorite compliment I've ever gotten is that I "have a disarming personality" and I'm pretty sure I can do the macarena to any song.

            And for the Adults: 
            I graduated with degrees in Computer Science and Business. I work on the Responsible AI team at Microsoft - I work with research and engineering people. My job is cool but I probably get equally if not more excited to work on all my side endeavors
