                        <p>The concept of merch is so cool because it allows people to easily promote things and ideas they love and want to associate with. And when I see someone wearing merch of something I'm also a fan of, I feel this automatic connection to them. It's almost like an invitation to go talk to them. But usually people only wear merch of things that they are "proud of" or "fans of" or have positive sentiment towards. It made me think what if you made merch around concepts that people are NOT necessarily proud of but identify with. "Anti-Merch". I'm curious if people would connect over "Anti-Merch" the same way they do with normal merch? And if so, could wearing "anti-merch" actually reduce stigmas / shame around certain concepts?</p>

                            <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">This one is interesting because I don't know how to feel about this one still. Something about this feels like it's trivializing the thing that happened. I lost my dad. I still love him and grieve him. It's a huge part of who I am and it does reflect me. I would want to connect with other people over it. But maybe this feels too performative and not precious? Maybe we shouldn't normalize suffering? It's a concept I'm thinking about. If you have thoughts, let me know!</p>
